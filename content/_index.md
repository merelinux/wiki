Mere Linux is a lightweight Linux distribution built around
[musl libc](https://musl.libc.org/) and
[s6](https://skarnet.org/software/s6/) for system initialization and process
supervision.

It also currently uses [pacman](https://www.archlinux.org/pacman/) for package
management, [busybox](https://busybox.net) for a suite of core utilities, and
[llvm+clang](https://llvm.org) as the main C compiler and toolchain.

Mere is under active development and is currently missing many features of a
a typical Linux distribution. It is however, steadily progressing. You can
monitor and contribute to its progress at
[https://github.com/jhuntwork/merelinux](https://github.com/jhuntwork/merelinux).
