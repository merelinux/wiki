# wiki
The main [merelinux.org](https://merelinux.org) website, generated via
[hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

Instead of a traditional wiki, in order to generate changes to the site,
please submit pull requests. This provides a way for anyone to contribute but
still allow validation and quality checks of content before going live.

Content changes/additions will typically go in the content directory. In
addition to [hugo documentation](https://gohugo.io/documentation/), the
[theme documentation](https://geekdocs.de/usage/getting-started/)
may be helpful.
